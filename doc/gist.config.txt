*gist.config.txt*  GistCreate configuration

DESCRIPTION
    The `:GistCreate` command can be configured to avoid prompting the user for the privacy settings of the Gist and target clipboard.
    This is done via the `setup()` function with the `config.clipboard` and `config.private`.
    The `:GistsList` command has mappings that allow you to cycle between files if a gist has multiple of them,
    you can also type to fuzzy find them.
    The mappings can be customized with the `config.list.mappings.{next_file, prev_file}` via the `setup()` function.
    
    When `list.use_multiplexer` is enabled, the plugin will automatically detect tmux or zellij and open gists in new multiplexer tabs.
    If no multiplexer is detected, gists are opened in read-only Neovim buffers for viewing.

OPTIONS
	private = false, will set the privacy to `public` by default.
    split_direction = "vertical", controls the split orientation when opening a gist. values: ["vertical" | "horizontal"]. default "vertical".
    gh_cmd = "gh", allows the specification of gh wrappers which handle, auth, etc. defaults to "gh"
	clipboard = "0", will set the clipboard to `+` by default, it is the unnamed_plus register `:h quoteplus`.
	list = {
        use_multiplexer = true, enables terminal multiplexer support (tmux/zellij) for editing gists. default false.
        limit = nil, limits the number of gists fetched. default nil (uses gh default of 10).
        read_only = false, Opens the given gists in read-only buffers. This option is ignored if use_multiplexer is `false`, default false
        next_file = "<C-n>",
        prev_file = "<C-p>",
	}
