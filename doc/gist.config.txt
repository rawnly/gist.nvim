*gist.config.txt*  GistCreate configuration

DESCRIPTION
    The `:GistCreate` command can be configured to avoid prompting the user for the privacy settings of the Gist and target clipboard.
    This is done via the `setup()` function with the `config.clipboard` and `config.private`.
    The `:GistsList` command has mappings that allow you to cycle between files if a gist has multiple of them,
    you can also type to fuzzy find them.
    The mappings can be customized with the `config.list.mappings.{next_file, prev_file}` via the `setup()` function.
